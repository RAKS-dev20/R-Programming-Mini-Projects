## Mini Projects Overview

### 01. Basics of Gene Analysis in R
**Concepts covered**
- Vectors and basic operations  
- Conditional statements  
- Simple statistical calculations  

**Description**  
This project focuses on understanding basic R syntax using simple gene-related data. It includes vector operations, logical comparisons, and basic summaries commonly used in biological data analysis.

---

### 02. Data Cleaning and Manipulation using dplyr
**Concepts covered**
- Data frames  
- Filtering and selecting data  
- mutate, arrange, and summarise functions  

**Description**  
This mini project demonstrates how to clean and manipulate gene expression–like datasets using the dplyr package. The focus is on readable and reproducible data transformation workflows.

---

### 03. Practical Case Study
**Concepts covered**
- Combining multiple R concepts  
- Working with structured datasets  
- Basic analysis workflow  

**Description**  
A small practical case study applying multiple R concepts together. This project simulates how R is used in real assignments or lab-based data analysis tasks.

---

### 04. Functions in R
**Concepts covered**
- Writing custom functions  
- Function arguments and return values  
- Code reusability  

**Description**  
This project focuses on writing reusable R functions for common analytical tasks, such as calculating fold changes or filtering significant values.

---

### 05. Apply Family Functions
**Concepts covered**
- apply, lapply, sapply  
- Replacing loops with functional programming  

**Description**  
This mini project demonstrates how apply family functions can be used to write cleaner and more efficient R code, especially for repetitive operations on matrices and data frames.

---

### 06. Data Structures in R
**Concepts covered**
- Vectors, lists, matrices, and data frames  
- Subsetting and indexing  

**Description**  
This project explores different R data structures and how to choose the appropriate structure depending on the data and analysis requirements.

---

### 07. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
**Concepts covered**
- Summary statistics  
- Distribution analysis  
- Identifying trends and outliers  

**Description**  
This project focuses on understanding datasets through exploratory analysis, including descriptive statistics and initial data interpretation.

---

### 08. Data Visualization using ggplot2
**Concepts covered**
- Grammar of Graphics  
- Scatter plots, boxplots, and volcano plots  
- Saving publication-quality figures  

**Description**  
This project demonstrates how to visualize gene expression–like data using ggplot2, with an emphasis on clear and interpretable plots suitable for reports and presentations.

---

### 09. Bioinformatics-Oriented Gene Analysis
**Concepts covered**
- Filtering biologically relevant genes  
- Basic interpretation of gene expression results  

**Description**  
A domain-focused project applying R programming skills to simple bioinformatics-style analyses, such as identifying significantly regulated genes.

---

### 10. Final Mini Case Study
**Concepts covered**
- End-to-end analysis workflow  
- Data loading, cleaning, analysis, and visualization  

**Description**  
This final project integrates multiple skills from earlier mini projects into a single, coherent analysis pipeline, simulating a small research workflow.
