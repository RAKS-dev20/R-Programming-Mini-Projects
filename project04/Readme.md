### Folder Description
- **data/**  
  Contains the raw input dataset used for analysis.

- **script/**  
  Contains the R script responsible for data cleaning, preprocessing, and filtering.

- **result/**  
  Stores the cleaned and filtered output dataset generated by the script.

## Dataset Description

The dataset represents gene expression measurements under different biological conditions. Some expression values are missing and must be handled before analysis.

### Columns
- **Gene**  
  Name of the gene.

- **Expression**  
  Numeric gene expression value. Missing values may be present.

- **Condition**  
  Biological condition associated with the gene (e.g., Tumor or Normal).

## Analysis Workflow

The analysis is performed in a step-by-step and reproducible manner:

1. Load the gene expression dataset from the `data` directory  
2. Inspect the structure and summary statistics of the data  
3. Convert expression values to numeric format  
4. Handle missing expression values by replacing them with the mean expression  
5. Convert the condition column to a factor  
6. Filter genes with high expression values (Expression > 7)  
7. Save the cleaned and filtered dataset to the `result` directory

## Script Overview

The main script performs the following operations:

- Reads data using relative file paths  
- Handles missing values using base R functions  
- Applies simple filtering logic to identify highly expressed genes  
- Writes results to a structured output folder  

This approach ensures portability and compatibility with GitHub-based workflows.

## Output

The final output is a CSV file containing only highly expressed genes:


This file can be directly used for visualization, statistical analysis, or further bioinformatics workflows.

## How to Run the Project

1. Open the project using the `.Rproj` file (if available)  
2. Ensure the working directory is set to the project root  
3. Run the script:

```r
source("script/gene_expression_cleaning.R")
