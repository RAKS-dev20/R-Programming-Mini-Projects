# Practical 03: Gene Expression Visualization

This project demonstrates a small end-to-end R workflow for analyzing and visualizing gene expression–like data using ggplot2.

## Project Structure

- `data/`  
  Contains the input gene expression dataset used for analysis.

- `create_data.R`  
  Script used to generate and save the dataset.

- `vizualization.R`  
  Main analysis and visualization script.

- `plots/`  
  Contains output plots generated during analysis, including scatter plots, boxplots, and a volcano plot.

## Tools Used
- R
- tidyverse
- ggplot2

## Objective
To practice data handling, visualization, and basic interpretation of gene expression results in R.

## Notes
This project is part of a larger collection of R programming mini projects created for learning and portfolio development.
